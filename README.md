-----

Instead of a scipy one-liner ( [linear sum assignment](#assign) ), we take the panoramic route and formulate it as an optimization
problem over the manifold of doubly-stochastic matrices, hoping to end up in a corner of the [Birkhoff polytope](#birkhoff).

~~If it works I'll write a blog post about it~~ UPDATE: it works
